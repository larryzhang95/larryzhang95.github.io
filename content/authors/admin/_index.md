I am a Dual PhD Student in the Department of Informatics (specializing in Complex Network Systems), and the Department of Intelligent Systems Engineering (specializing in Neuroengineering) at Indiana University Bloomington (IU) as a Fellow of the [CNS-NRT Program](https://cns-nrt.indiana.edu/) funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF). I am co-advised by [Yong-Yeol Ahn](https://yongyeol.com/) and [Gregory Lewis](https://sociophysio.org/).

My research focuses on applying computational and cognitive models to measurements from multimodal behavioral sensing technologies (e.g. voice recordings, heart rate, pose, language) to enable and accelerate theory building around neuropsychiatric health and general wellbeing. I am particularly interested in developing cheap, non-invasive measures of neuropsychiatric state to make psychiatric healthcare more accessible to all. Currently, I am studying computational methods for assessing cross-modal synchrony in behavioral and neuroscientific studies.

Prior to IU, I worked on research at the Institute of Creative Technologies at the University of Southern California, where I worked with [Mohammad Soleymani](https://people.ict.usc.edu/~soleymani/) and [Stefan Scherer](https://schererstefan.net/) studying multimodal behavioral sensing in substance abuse disorders and psychological distress. I also worked with [Reza Hosseini Ghomi](http://www.brainmindedmd.com/about.html) and [Trevor Cohen](http://bime.uw.edu/faculty/trevor-cohen/) at the University of Washington studying vocal biomarkers and the clinical application of semantic memory networks for cognitive decline. I continue to study semantic memory search with [Michael Jones](https://www.compcog.com/) at IU.
