abstract: "**Importance:** Depression is an illness affecting a large percentage of the world's population throughout the lifetime. To date, there is no available biomarker for depression detection and tracking of symptoms relies on patient self-report.

**<br><br>Objective:** To explore and validate features extracted from recorded voice samples of depressed subjects as digital biomarkers for suicidality, psychomotor disturbance, and depression severity.

**<br><br>Design:** We conducted a cross-sectional study over the course of 12 months using a frequently visited web form version of the PHQ9 hosted by Mental Health America (MHA) to ask subjects for anonymous voice samples via a separate web form hosted by NeuroLex Laboratories. Subjects were asked to provide demographics, answers to the PHQ9, and two voice samples.

**<br><br>Setting:** Online only.

**<br><br>Participants:** Users of the MHA website.

**<br><br>Main Outcomes and Measures:** Performance of statistical models using extracted voice features to predict psychomotor disturbance, suicidality, and depression severity as indicated by the PHQ9.

**<br><br>Results:** Voice features extracted from recorded audio of depressed subjects were able to predict PHQ9 question 9 and total scores with an area under the curve of 0.821 and a mean absolute error of 4.7, respectively. Psychomotor Disturbance prediction was less powerful with an area under the curve of 0.61.

**<br><br>Conclusion and Relevance** Automated voice analysis using short recordings of patient speech may be used to augment depression screen and symptom management."
