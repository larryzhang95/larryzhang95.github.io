abstract: "Motivational Interviewing (MI) is defined as a collaborative conversation style that evokes the client’s own intrinsic reasons for
behavioral change. In MI research, the clients’ attitude (willingness or resistance) toward change as expressed through language,
has been identified as an important indicator of their subsequent
behavior change. Automated coding of these indicators provides
systematic and efficient means for the analysis and assessment of
MI therapy sessions. In this paper, we study and analyze behavioral cues in client language and speech that bear indications of the
client’s behavior toward change during a therapy session, using a
database of dyadic motivational interviews between therapists and
clients with alcohol-related problems. Deep language and voice encoders, i.e., BERT and VGGish, trained on large amounts of data are
used to extract features from each utterance. We develop a neural
network to automatically detect the MI codes using both the clients’
and therapists’ language and clients’ voice, and demonstrate the
importance of semantic context in such detection. Additionally, we
develop machine learning models for predicting alcohol-use behavioral outcomes of clients through language and voice analysis. Our
analysis demonstrates that we are able to estimate MI codes using
clients’ textual utterances along with preceding textual context
from both the therapist and client, reaching an F1-score of 0.72
for a speaker-independent three-class classification. We also report initial results for using the clients’ data for predicting behavioral
outcomes, which outlines the direction for future work."
